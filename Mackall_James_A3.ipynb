We will work with the Amazon product reviews dataset for this project. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model.\n","\n","--------------\n","## **Context:**\n","--------------\n","\n","Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity and variety throughout the globe. This has lead to information overload, and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers and they often turn to denial. Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help recommending products to consumers while they are browsing online. Providing personalized recommendations which is most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help business.\n","\n","E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n","\n","Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations in its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences in order to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n","\n","----------------\n","## **Objective:**\n","----------------\n","\n","You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.\n","\n","-----------------------------\n","## **Dataset:**\n","-----------------------------\n","\n","The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:\n","\n","- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id\n","- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id\n","- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n","- **timestamp:** Time of the rating.

The collaborative filtering models also took significantly shorter to optimize than the SVD models.\n","\n","- Clustering did not perform well with this dataset, likely because there weren't enough variables to find specific clusters with.\n","\n","- Balancing ranking predictions with a ranking product, which in this case we based on product popularity, allows for a way to discern between otherwise similarly rated predictions and choose the product most likely to be selected.\n","\n","- The SVD model, and likely the other ones as well, had some clear favorite products.  It is likely that these products were simply the highest rated in the dataset, and with no other features or selection criteria other than rating, this is bound to happen.\n","\n","**Recommendations:**\n","\n","- It would be worthwhile for Amazon to consider recording when products are purchased but not rated.  This could be a potential relevant indicator in the quality of a product, considering that no review likely means the product was not good or bad enough to warrent the user leaving said review.\n","\n","- Clustering might be a method worth implementing if there are more categories within the data, but in the case of one ordinal variable such as rating, it does not provide much utility aside from another way to generate reccomendations.\n","\n","- Overall, the more data Amazon can collect on users and products in addition to ratings, the more specific the recommendation systems can get.  These results are already pretty good for only having one variable to work with, with every model producing a RMSE of less than 1 (and thus, being on average, less than one star off).  If there were more features, such as category of product, user's recently shopped categories, product brand, etc, it is likely that rating predictions would experience less RMSE, have more personalization towards users, and more variety between products recommended.\n","\n","- If Amazon were to implement these recommendation systems, they would benefit from a hybrid approach.  While the User-User collaborative filtering model might capture some similaries in products two users might like, they can't specifically look for similar items like Item-Item filtering does.  And neither are as accurate as SVD.  Amazon does not know what the user is looking for every time the go on the website.  However, if they show multiple feeds of different types of product recommendations, it is likely that between the different models, the user will see something they like and will hopefully purchase."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Mj0K_Nini1Sz","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1738813374123,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":65896,"user":{"displayName":"James Mackall","userId":"00269686780610187298"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
